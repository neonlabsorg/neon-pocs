1. [Aave V3 flash loan with composability requests to Solana](./contracts/AaveFlashLoan)
2. [MemeLaunchpad with composability requests to Solana](./contracts/MemeLaunchpad)

> [!NOTE]
> This repository includes Hardhat 3 which requires the support of Node.js v22 or later installed on your system, along 
> with a package manager such as npm or pnpm.

### Secret values setup
Secret values (such as private keys) used in tests and scripts should be stored using Hardhat's encrypted keystore file.
This keystore file is specific to this _Hardhat_ project, you can run the following command in the CLI to display the
keystore file path for this _Hardhat_ project:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore path
```

To store encrypted secret values into this project's Hardhat keystore file, run the following commands in the CLI:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set PRIVATE_KEY_OWNER
```
```shell
npx hardhat keystore set PRIVATE_KEY_SOLANA
```

You will be asked to choose a password (which will be used to encrypt provided secrets) and to enter the secret values
to be encrypted. The keystore password can be added to the `.env` file (as `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`)  which allows secrets
to be decrypted automatically when running Hardhat tests and scripts. Otherwise, each running Hardhat test and script
will have the CLI prompt a request to enter the keystore password manually.

> [!CAUTION]
> Although it is not recommended (as it involves risks of leaking secrets) it is possible to store plain-text secrets in
`.env` file using the same keys as listed above. When doing so, user will be asked to confirm wanting to use plain-text
secrets found in `.env` file when running Hardhat tests and scripts.
